# BigDataParallelAlgorithms

Tis package implements parallel algorithms for big data analysis in omic settings. The functions will consider as input an object of class `DelayedArray` which is an array-like object (typically an on-disk object) specifically designed for Bioconductor. The methods will also accept other type of objects as those designed to deal with big matrices in the `Matrix` pacKage. The implemented methods will include:

- Data reduction (Principal Component Analysis, Canonical Correlation, Partial Least Squares, ...)
- Linear regression models
- Penalized methods for linear regression (Lasso, Elastic Net, ...)
- Omic data integration (Penalized Generalized Canonical Correlation)
- Supervised and non-supervised algorithms
